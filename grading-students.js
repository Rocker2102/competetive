/*
HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

Every student receives a grade in the inclusive range from 0 to 100.
Any grade less than 40 is a failing grade.

Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's grade according to these rules:
- If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round  up to the next multiple of 5.
- If the value of grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.

Examples
- grade = 84, round to  (85 - 84 is less than 3)
- grade = 29, do not round (result is less than 40)
- grade = 57, do not round (60 - 57 is 3 or higher)
Given the initial value of grade for each of Sam's n students, write code to automate the rounding process.

Function Description
Complete the function gradingStudents in the editor below.

gradingStudents has the following parameter(s):
- int grades[n]: the grades before rounding

Returns
- int[n]: the grades after rounding as appropriate

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer, n, the number of students.
Each line i of the n subsequent lines contains a single integer, grades[i].

Constraints
- 1 <= n <= 60
- 0 <= grades[i] <= 100
